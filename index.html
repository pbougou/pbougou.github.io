        About me
      </h2>

      <p>
          I' m a functional programmer interested in programming languages research. My research <br /> 
          interests lie in functional programming, type systems, compilers, and program verification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I' m completing my thesis in <a style="font-style: italic;"> Tail-calls in lazy functional languages </a> 
        at Software Engineering Laboratory at National Technical University of Athens under the
        supervision <br /> 
        of Prof. <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~nickie/">Nikolaos Papaspyrou</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student, I implemented software for many projects alone or with my fellow students. <br />
        These include, but not limited to, a full&ndash;stack web application 
        &mdash; called <a href= "https://github.com/pbougou/fsociety" style="font-style: italic;">FunSociety</a> &mdash; 
        for <br />
        Software Engineering course, in a group of 7 students, a compiler for <a style="font-style:italic;">Dana</a>, an imperative <br /> 
        Turing&ndash;complete programming language for Compilers course, a virtual&ndash;machine for an <br /> 
        esoteric programming language &mdash; <a href= "https://github.com/pbougou/proglangs" style="font-style: italic;">Befunge93</a>, 
        and type inference a la <a href= "https://github.com/pbougou/proglangs" style="font-style: italic;">Hidney-Milner </a>
        for <br />
        the simply-typed lambda calculus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and watching movies. Also, I love hiking, even <br />
        more when this time is shared with my dog, <a href="images/OLIVER.JPG">Oliver</a>, who is truthfully 
        full of kindness!
